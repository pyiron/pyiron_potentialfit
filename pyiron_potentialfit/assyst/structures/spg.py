    Generate random crystal structures with PyXtal.

    `group` must be between 1 and the largest possible value for the given dimensionality:
        dim=3 => 1 - 230 (space groups)
        dim=2 => 1 -  80 (layer groups)
        dim=1 => 1 -  75 (rod groups)
        dim=0 => 1 -  58 (point groups)

    When `group` is passed as a list of integers or `repeat>1`, generate multiple structures and return them in a :class:`.StructureStorage`.

    Args:
        group (list of int, or int): the symmetry group to generate or a list of them
        species (tuple of str): which species to include, defines the stoichiometry together with `num_ions`
        num_ions (tuple of int): how many of each species to include, defines the stoichiometry together with `species`
        dim (int): dimensionality of the symmetry group, 0 is point groups, 1 is rod groups, 2 is layer groups and 3 is space groups
        repeat (int): how many random structures to generate
        storage (:class:`.StructureStorage`, optional): when generating multiple structures, add them to this instead of creating a new storage
        allow_exceptions (bool): when generating multiple structures, silence errors when the requested stoichiometry and symmetry group are incompatible
        **kwargs: passed to `pyxtal.pyxtal` function verbatim

    Returns:
        :class:`~.Atoms`: the generated structure, if repeat==1 and only one symmetry group is requested
        :class:`.StructureStorage`: a storage of all generated structure, if repeat>1 or multiple symmetry groups are requested

    Raises:
        ValueError: if stoichiometry and symmetry group are incompatible and allow_exceptions==False or only one structure is requested
